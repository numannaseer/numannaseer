- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @numannaseer
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Backend Web Development(MERN-Stack)
- I am a passionate Web App Developer with over 6 months of experience. Having a bachelor's degree in Computer Science (B.E, CSE), I have worked as a MERN Stack Web Developer Trainee and Intern at multiple reputed organizations.

I believe Web Development is an art. Just like an artist uses his brush and colour palette to paint a beautiful image to please the audience in an art gallery, a Web App Developer at client side uses his designing and coding skills to develop a beautiful Web app interface to please the end-users, and at the same time ensures a seamless experience by developing efficient server side applications.

I love learning new things. I like exploring a topic in depth and I don't give up easily which makes me stand apart from other developers. Iam always curious about how stuff works under the hood whether it is coding or other aspects of life. I prefer working in an organization which not only values its clients but its employees as well.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science & ios development
