- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @numannaseer
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Backend Web Development(MERN-Stack)
- I am a passionate Web App Developer with over 8 months of experience. Having a bachelor's degree in Computer Science (B.E, CSE), I have worked as a MERN Stack Web Developer Trainee and Intern at multiple reputed organizations.

I believe Web Development is an art. Just like an artist uses his brush and colour palette to paint a beautiful image to please the audience in an art gallery, a Web App Developer at client side uses his designing and coding skills to develop a beautiful Web app interface to please the end-users, and at the same time ensures a seamless experience by developing efficient server side applications.

I love learning new things. I like exploring a topic in depth and I don't give up easily which makes me stand apart from other developers. Iam always curious about how stuff works under the hood whether it is coding or other aspects of life. I prefer working in an organization which not only values its clients but its employees as well.










My Skill Set (Development, Design & Maintenance):-

DEVELOPMENT: 

The work primarily includes developing Responsive Websites using technologies like HTML5, CSS3 with Flexbox & Grid, JS based on ES6 and successive scripts, frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS, libraries like ReactJS, Redux and jQuery.

I extensively work with Axios library for making HTTP requests to servers. Postman is one of the API testing platforms, I frequently use during development.

My Backend knowledge includes well acquaintance with server-side runtime platform like Node.js with Express.js framework and MongoDB DBMS. I am also familiar with Python, C, C++ and PHP programming languages, and MySQL DBMS.




DESIGN & MAINTENANCE: 

The goal is to design interfaces as per client's requirements by selecting color palettes which are appealing to the end-users and at the same time ensuring a user friendly structure with good user flow for the Responsive Websites.

I use Git Bash, Hyper CLI and GitKraken GUI for Local Version Control Management, and GitHub, an online platform for Remote Version Control Management.

Considering maintenance an important aspect, from time to time after deployment, I check if my developed websites are responsive and bug-free. Verifying browser independence and handling user feedback is also a part of my maintenance phase.
